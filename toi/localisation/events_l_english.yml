 #c0_government.1.t:0 "Questioning the Status Quo"
 #c0_government.1.desc.m:0 "For centuries our nation has followed the traditions of the past, organising our people under heirarchies and valuing what was written long ago more than what we need now. \nFollowing the incoming tide of industrialisation and modernisation, perhaps it is time for us to make some changes.\n"
 #c0_government.1.desc.d:0 "We have escaped from the tyranny of monarchies for a while, but it remains true that the influences of the past still shadow the future we may take. \nIn the ever changing world, it is only right for us to embrace the new norm, through the questioning of what was common sense in the past.\n"
 #c0_government.1.a:0 "Summon the council and start a discussion."

 #c0_government.2.desc:0 "Recently the leader of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] has expressed his discontent about the current government. Unprecedented in [ROOT.GetAdjective] history, we all are clueless on their intentions and what this will bring to the nation.\n"
 #c0_government.2.a:0 "It is about time."
 #c0_government.3.t:0 "Reformation within the Government"
 #c0_government.3.desc.a:0 "After a thourough discussion on the topic of reformation, our council has layed out the optimal options for our situation. On top of this, we must first decide how quickly we will implement these reformations."
 #c0_government.3.desc.b:0 "We have examined the examples of the succesful nations and their policies. While some are worrying if these policies will work for our nation, we must first decide how quickly we will implement these reformations."

 #c0_government.5.t:0 "First Policy Put in Order"
 #c0_government.5.desc:0 "An exciting moment in the [ROOT.GetAdjective] history, the first policy under the name of the reformation has been taken. We worry if it will bring success or turmoil to our nation, but at first glance we are making great strides."
 #c0_government.5.a:0 "We have already come halfway."
 #c0_government.5.b:0 "A healthy dose of criticism is always a good idea."
 #c0_government.X.t:0 "The Reformation is Succesful"
 #c0_government.X.desc:0 "Quite some time has gone since we first started our reformation policies, and during such we have put these ideas to the test. While it is impossible to eliminate all dissentients within our government about our new stance, we have proved the benefits of an opened system through industrial growth and the content of our people."

 sepoy.1.t:0 "The Sepoy Mutiny"
 sepoy.1.d:0 "The year is 1857, and our country has suddenly been ripped into an abyss of turmoil and war. Rising conflict between the British East India Company and our people have led to an incident this morning that has sparked a war: A Mutiny in Meerut. Our country is now in a state of war with the company and on both sides mobilization efforts have just begun. Will this be the war that guarantees Freedom for India?"

 sepoy.3.d:0 "The hearts of our citizens are set aflame by the revolt, it seems, and in a major effort, many of them have come together during the last few days to erect fortifications in the cities of Delhi and Lucknow!

 sepoy.4.t:0 "Pressure from Sepoy"
 sepoy.4.d:0 "The Rebellion in Sepoy has severely affected our country - even though we are occupied by the British and therefore have to fight for them, our populace is extremely dissatisfied with our decision. The calls for us to abandon the British and join the Sepoy in their rebellion are getting louder and louder - what shall we do?"
 sepoy.4.a:0 "Join them - its about time we drove the British out."

 usa.2.d:0 "We have received terrible news: The proud SS Central America, also called \"The Ship of Gold\" has crashed in a hurricane, costing over 400 lives and 14 tons of gold. The economic crisis we are already suffering is only amplified by this, and the nations mourns its dead."
 usa.2.a:0 "Oh, the humanity!"
 usa.3.t:0 "The Slavery Debate"
 usa.3.d:0 "The Issue of Slavery has lingered as long as the United States has been. Our founding fathers could not solve the issue, nor the generation after that. All they have done is passed the torch of the Slave Issue to us, and the tensions of Slavery is starting to boil..."

 usa.4.t:0 "Uncle Tom's Cabin"
 usa.4.d:0 "Although released back in 1852, the book Uncle Tom's Cabin has grown more and more popular as the years go by. The book featured the character Uncle Tom, a long-suffering black slave, and the novel shows the horrible truths of slavery, while also asserting that Christian love can overcome something as destructive as slavery. This gave the book much praise in the North, but led to outrage in the slave-heavy South."

 usa.4.c:0 "Encourage the Book!"
 usa.4.e:0 "It's just some book, who cares?"
 usa.5.t:0 "Effects of Dred Scott"
 usa.5.d:0 "The Dred Scott vs Sandford case was cleared up on March 6th, 1857. The result was ruled that Dred Scott, who resided in a fre state, was not entitled to his freedom and that African-Americans could not be citizens of the United States.

 usa.5.b:0 "Overturn the Ruling."
 usa.5.c:0 "Pardon Dred Scott."
 usa.5.e:0 "Commend the Ruling."
 usa.6.t:0 "Bleeding Kansas"
 usa.6.d:0 "Introduced by Stephen Douglas in 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska act allowed for the people in the Kansas and Nebraska territories to choose if they would want slavery or not. This has led to many Northern Abolitionists and Southern Pro-Slavers to move to Kansas to push for their beliefs in the conflict of Slavery. This has spilled blood many times, one example being abolitionist John Brown who led his sons and other followers to attack farmers who supported slavery. \n \nRecently, the Marais des Cygnes massacre occured, where Pro-Slavery Border Ruffians killed 5 Anti-Slavery men. With the tensions of the Slave Debate, this has led to more conflict in the Kansas Territory."

Thankfully, Colonel Robert E. Lee and his men were able to defeat Brown's part of 22 and retake the arsenal. He was able to capture 7, including John Brown, while 10 were killed and 5 fled before being captured."

 usa.8.t:0 "John Brown's Execution"
 usa.8.d:0 "Since the President's orders on what to do with John Brown had gone lost, John Brown had been ordered by Lee to be executed. In his memoir before being executed, John Brown wrote: \"I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood. I had, as I now think, vainly flattered myself that without very much bloodshed it might be done.\" In the North, many have called him a martyr, while the South is relieved that their terrorist is gone."
 usa.8.a:0 "Don't let either side use this as propaganda!"

 usa.8.c:0 "Death of a Martyr!"
 usa.8.e:0 "He is just a criminal. I don't care."
 usa.9.t:0 "The Compromise of 1850 and Fugitive Slave Act"
 usa.9.d:0 "In 1850, in order to deal with the new territory from the Mexican-American War, the United States was divided again on slavery, until it came to the Compromise of 1850. In the contents, it issued many things, such as California's admission as a Free State. \n \nHowever, issues are arising with the Fugitive Slave Law that was enacted alongsie with the Compromise. Any Slave that fled into the North was to be taken back to their slaveowners. This has led to it becoming a issue with the Slavery Debate heating up, and some Northerners have been arrested for having hid runaway slaves in order to protect them."
 usa.9.a:0 "Go along with the Compromise"
 usa.9.b:0 "Attempt to Renegotiate"
 usa.9.c:0 "Just let Congress handle this."

 usa.10.t:0 "Election of 1860"
 usa.10.d:0 "The day has come, for every American to leave their homes and head to the polls to vote for who will become President. \n \nThe campaigning was tough, with the issue of Slavery in the primary light of the issue. The Republican Party's nominee is Abraham Lincoln, a charismatic figure that opposes expansion of Slavery. The Democratic Party is split between two, the Northern Democrats favor Stephen A Douglas, who favors a moderate solution in Slavery and therefore will likely not recieve many votes. But the Southern Democrats demand for John Beckinridge, current Vice President under Buchanan, who promises to ensure the institution of slavery in the west. \n \nThis may be the tipping point that decides on the issue of slavery. If either North nor South get their candidate, they may rebel against the current system. But for now, the new President of the United States is..."

 usa.10.c:0 "Northern Democrat Stephen Douglas"
 usa.11.t:0 "Abraham Lincoln Inaugurated"
 usa.11.d:0 "Earlier today, the new President Abraham Lincoln was sworn in as President of the United States. In his inaugural address, he argued that the Constitution created a more perfect union than the Articles of Confederation, and that the secession of the South be called illegal.

 usa.12.t:0 "Stephen Douglas Inaugurated"
 usa.12.d:0 "Earlier today, the new President Stephen Douglas was sworn in as President of the United States. In his inaugural address, he argued that the Constitution created a balance between State and Federal power, and that the secession of the South be negotiated with. He calls for the Union to be strong, or else the National Experiment would die."
 usa.12.a:0 "Inspiring Words"
 usa.13.t:0 "Settlers Move for Oppertunity"
 usa.13.d:0 "The idea of Manifest Destiny is still strong within the American people, and they see lands that have yet to be colonized. They gladly take up the call, and recently a large group had headed out to find a new home."
 usa.13.a:0 "Good for them."
 usa.14.t:0 "Volunteers for the Union!"
 usa.14.d:0 "As we prepare to go to war with the traitorous south, many eager citizens volunteer to serve in our armed forces!"
 usa.14.a:0 "Rise my minions!"
 usa.15.t:0 "Breath after the Vote"
 usa.15.d:0 "The Election had just gone underway with Stephen Douglas being elected into office. Although Stephen has not yet been inaugerated, he has been busy with work. He has noted the division in the United States over the issue of Slavery, and sees that unless he is to stop it now, a brutal war may be on the horizen. \n \nHe consults with his advisors on the matter, where they discuss how to solve the issue. \n \nStephen's advisors point out the fact that we need to calm the populace of the United States if we are to do anything that could stop a possible war..."
 usa.15.a:0 "Rally them in a speech"
 usa.15.b:0 "Put out Propaganda posters"
 usa.15.c:0 "Promise them something"
 usa.15.e:0 "Divert their attention to something else"
 usa.16.t:0 "What to promise?"
 usa.16.d:0 "We seem to have gotten the people's attention, as the debates across the nation over the issue of slavery seems to be hushing. But we have only gotten their attention, if we do not give them a solution that everyone likes, then it would reignite this debate with harsher fervor. \n \nStephen's advisors had come together and have presented four possible solutions that we can promise to the people. We must choose carefully..."
 usa.16.a:0 "Promise autonomy to the South"
 usa.16.b:0 "Promise a Better form of Slavery"
 usa.16.c:0 "Promise Status-Quo"
 usa.16.e:0 "Promise a Referendum"
 usa.17.t:0 "The Slavery Referendum"
 usa.17.d:0 "To the suprise of Stephen and even some of his advisors, the Promise for a Referendum has been generally accepted across the United States. It seems as though the only ones that would refuse this were the rich White plantation owners in the South and radical abolitionists in the North, who have lost support when the Referendum had been announced. \n \nThere have been four different plans for the Referendum. 1: The Abolition Plan, which, if passed, would ban the practice of Slavery. 2: The Popular Sovreignity Plan, which people can vote if their state wants or doesn't want slavery. 3: The 30 Years Plan, where the US would slowly cut down on Slavery until Abolishment in a span of 30 years. Or 4: The Reformed Slavery Plan, which promises to implement a form of Slavery that prohibits harsh treatment of Slaves. \n \nThe time to choose is now, the fate of the nation is in our hands..."
 usa.17.a:0 "The Abolition Plan!"

 usa.17.c:0 "The 30-Year Plan!"
 usa.17.e:0 "The Reformed Slavery Plan!"
 usa.18.t:0 "Civil War Avoided!"
 usa.18.d:0 "The people have gone to the polls, we have tallied up the numbers, and the election is over. The people have spoken, the 30 Year Plan shall be implemented into the United States! Although this will upset some of the Radicals from both sides, this has drastically calmed tensions on both sides. It seems like Stephen A. Douglas has brought the nation together, and has finally solved the issue on slavery. Although it is not immediate, but one day Slavery will be abolished, and by that time the plantations would probably not need the Institution of Slavery to run. \n \nThe United States will stay United."
 usa.18.a:0 "Hail Columbia!"
 usa.19.t:0 "People return to Bickering"
 usa.19.d:0 "The brief moment we had the people's attention is now gone. They have rejected our proposal, and have turned back on each other to argue and debate. It seems like Stephen's nightmare is about to come..."
 usa.19.a:0 "Oh no..."
 usa.20.t:0 "The Drake Well"
 usa.20.d:0 "On August 28th, 1859, George Bissell and Edwin Drake completed the Drake Well in Titusville, Pennsylvania. It would become the first successful usage of a oil rig on a well that was specifically drilled to produce oil. Instead of drilling for salt water and removing the oil had orignially been a byproduct of making the salted water drinkable. However, with the increasing demand for oil to be used for candles and lamps to light up homes, the Drake Well signaled that the Pretroleum Industry would become a major industry on the World Market."
 usa.20.a:0 "Great news!"
 usa.21.t:0 "Thirty Years Plan - Second Decade"
 usa.21.d:0 "We begin to transition into the next decade of the Thirty Years Plan. As of now, the process of de-slaverizing the nation has undergone progress, but it requires more time in order to help the blacks slowly be disintegrated out of enslavement."
 usa.21.a:0 "Great News!"
 usa.22.t:0 "Thirty Years Plan - Third Decade"
 usa.22.d:0 "The transition into the next decade has been slow, but a steady progress. Although Slavery is not gone, the amount of slaves are vastly smaller than they were Twenty Years ago."
 usa.22.a:0 "Great News!"
 usa.23.t:0 "The Abolition Act"
 usa.23.d:0 "The Thirty Years Plan is over, and is a resounding success. Although it was hard at first, we were eventually able to convince Southern Plantation owners towards the use of wages, and the Blacks that have been enslaved have been given starts that will allow them to gain jobs. Although it is not paradise, we can finally enact the Abolition Act and finally end the Thirty Year Plan, and fulfill Douglas's plan for the future."
 usa.23.a:0 "Be Free!"
 usa.24.t:0 "Escapee Policy"
 usa.24.d:0 "The Confederacy has given us a distress, and had stated how some of our citizens had allowed and even helped their slaves in the escape of their servitude. They demand that we put a end to the underground railroad, and arrest any citizens that help escaping slaves moving north."
 usa.24.a:0 "Keep the Underground Railroad"
 usa.24.b:0 "Stop them from escaping..."
 usa.25.t:0 "Confederate Persecution"
 usa.25.d:0 "The Confederate leaders have gone into hiding. With the large population of southeners who would be glad to help hide them, aswell as the fact that they could have fled the country by now, poses us with a question of how far we should persecute these confederate leaders."
 usa.25.a:0 "No need, they're in exile now."
 usa.25.b:0 "We need to be on a lookout for them..."
 usa.25.c:0 "Put all of our resources on this!"
 usa.26.t:0 "The Pig War"
 usa.26.d:0 "The Oregon Treaty of 1846 resolved the boundary dispute by divided the United States and British boundaries to be along the forty-ninth parallel, which established a straight-lined border. However, the San Juan Islands have been disputed to be a part of Vancouver, which both parties agreed that the entirey of Vancouver Island would go to Britain. \n \nThe Dispute escalated, when an American farmer shot a British pig that was eating his farm's crops. After the farmer and the owner of the pig refused to negotiate, the British and American authorities were called. \n \nWhen news of this reached Washington and London, both governments agreed to establish military camps in the islands until a compromise can be made."

 usa.26.b:0 "Establish the British Camp!"
 usa.27.t:0 "Pig War - Negotiation"
 usa.27.d:0 "After 12 years of indecisiveness, a breakthrough in the negotiations for the San Juan islands happened. As in 1871, the United States and United Kingdom would sign the Treaty of Washington, which cleared up with numerous issues both nations have for each other. More imporantly, this included the border issues with the newly formed Dominion of Canada, and specifically the San Juan Island dispute. \n \nIt was agreed by both nations that a international arbitrator should decide who the islands go to. In a random choice, it was decided that [PRS.GetLeader] would be the deciding arbitrator for the dispute."

 usa.28.d:0 "Last morning, American and British negotiators arrived in Berlin today, and have come with a request. They have been having a dispute with one another over the San Juan islands, which almost led to war between them when a pig was shot in 1859. They have decided that they would resolve the issue by means of international arbitration, and the [Root.GetName] was randomly chosen to be the judge. \n \nThe Americans and british would wish for us to choose and decide their issue. After debating with his advisors, [Root.GetLeader] has decided who it belongs to."

 usa.31.d:0 "This morning, Virginia plantation owner George Washington Parke Custis died at the ripe old age of 79. Although not biologically related, he was adopted by Martha and George Washington. With the death of a man so close to the Founder of our nation, he would be remembered dearly, especially Mary Anna Custis Lee, his daughter who married General Robert E. Lee, who recieved the Arlington Plantion and lion's share of the inheritance."
 usa.31.a:0 "A moment of silence..."
 usa.32.t:0 "Question the Republic"
 usa.32.d:0 "The United States is at a standstill, our Republic is threatened by internal forces, with some of our people considering a coup against our government! The slow process of our reconstruction has stirred attention, aswell as the failure of the government to properly reunite with the south has led to major politicla upheavel. With this undergoing around us, we stand at a forked path, but the path we go down depends on how Congress sees the threat of these Anti-Republicans... \n \nThe first path would be of negotiation. The Democratic and Republican parties are vying each other and blame the other for the failure to reunite with the South. If we were to put in effort into making sure they cooperate with each other, we can ensure the safety of the United States. \n \nThe other path, however, involves the oppertunistic apporach in this. If we were to take advantage of the situation, we could potentially coup the government and install a new power in Washington..."

 usa.33.t:0 "Rethink the Republic"
 usa.33.d:0 "The siuation is as dire as it was before the Civil War, with the Republican party and the Democratic party on even harsher terms with each other. The political situation is fierce, with utmost hatred being traded between the two parties. This partisanship, however, has made it viable for other parties and ideologies to gain traction. They spout that they are the only way for the nation to survive, and with the political landscape, actually seem to be able to pose a threat to Congress. There are two major factions arising from this landscape, which are the two who pose the greatest threat to Congress. \n \nSome Radical Republicans, angered at the fact that the South had won and what they see as slow process in integrating African-Americans, had gone and formed a coalition of radicals. Some of those in these groups proscribe to Socialist and even Communistic ideas, which would hold the United States the distinction of being classified as Socialist if this coalition gained power. \n \nOn the other side holds a very outragous idea to a normal American: The installation of a Monarch. The Monarchist side, with a coalition of autocrats, religious fanatics, and even radical democrats, pose a serious threat to Congress. They are led by the charismatic Joshua Norton, who proclaimed himself Emperor of the United States in San Fransisco back in 1859. \n \nWhatever side it is, the political landscape of the United States makes it impossible for Congress to oppose these factions, who rival each other in their vie for power..."

With the nation too tired of war and still recovering from the Civil War, aswell as all of the opposing leaders being surrounded by the Socialists, Congress eventually surrendered and let power peacefully transfer to the Radicals. \n \nNow, the Radical Republicans hold power over the United States, and although the more moderate side of the Coalition holds the most power, the Elections that will happen soon may change that.

With the nation too tired of war and still recovering from the Civil War, aswell as all of the opposing leaders being surrounded by the Monarchists, Congress eventually surrendered and let power peacefully transfer to Norton I, who was crowned King of America. \n \nNow, the Monarchists hold power over the United States, and although the more moderate side of the Coalition took power, the descisions that the new King will make may modify the new political landscape.

They did notice that their policeman John Frederick Parker, who was assigned to guarding the president's box, was missing. However, it is assumed that he had simply gone to the tavern for a drink, and should be back shortly. \n \nThen, after the intermission, the infamous line played 'Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal; you sockdologizing old man-trap!'.
