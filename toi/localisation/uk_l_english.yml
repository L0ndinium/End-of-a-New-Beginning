 ENG_sepoy_rebellion_desc:0 "The mutiny that has risen in the 10th at Meerut has erupted to a point we no longer can ignore, and the army of the Seopy reached Delhi, declaring Bahadur Shah Zafar as the Emperor of Hindustan. This we no longer can stand, and through interverence we must secure the jewel of the empire."

 ENG_orsini_affair_desc:0 "Following the Orsini Attempt and the fact that it was supplied by British radicalists, suspicions arose within the French that the assasination was intervened by the British government. A despatch was sent requiring the restriction of right of asylum towards political refugees, and this has lead to diplomatic consequences between the two nations."

 ENG_question_eic:0 "Question the E.I.C."
 ENG_question_eic_desc:0 "The Rebellion has shaken our grasp onto India, but has not derailed it. The strength of the Company has proved to be obsolete compared to different measures, whether it be closer affiliation between the British and Indian, the lack of compensation for the princes, or the rigid social structure of the Indians. Whatever the solution may be, the E.I.C. has lost our trust."
 ENG_direct_rule_india:0 "Impose Direct Rule on India"
 ENG_direct_rule_india_desc:0 "Despite many calls for the increase of local rule within India, respecting the traditions of the backward monarchies have only proved to make holes for them to break through. The only solution is to dissolute the Company, and enforce direct  rule from Queen Victoria herself."
 ENG_form_raj:0 "Form the Raj"
 ENG_form_raj_desc:0 "While to not go as far as abolishing all privileges of the local rulers and princely states, giving them sovereignty outside of British rule, or under a nominal federation has lead to a crisis that has caused too much sacrifice. In order of prevention,  security and stability, British India will be ruled under the state of the British Raj, and will act as the frontline of the British Empire."
 ENG_federalize_princely_states:0 "Federalize the Princely States"
 ENG_federalize_princely_states_desc:0 "We have been successful in our efforts to compensate with the local governments. Solidifying this, we must create a new concept to unite the previously dispersed Princely States under one entity, while respecting each one of their identities. Uniting the 'breakwaters in the storm' will form a new front in Western Asia, and the British Empire will stand atop it."
 ENG_local_governments:0 "Local Governments"
 ENG_local_governments_desc:0 "Following the Rebellion, the Princely States have shown to be an obsolete figure in the state they are in. Change is imminent, and crucial for the British rule over India, and a new approach is required. The Rebellion, and many problems stemming from the traditional rule has fault in our failure to cooperate with the Indians, and refusing to do so has proved against us. It is time to give the locals the power they deserve."
 ENG_ceasefire_sepoy:0 "Ceasefire with the Sepoy"
 ENG_ceasefire_sepoy_desc:0 "Our campaign against the Rebellion has ultimately come to a halt, and the Parliament has decided it would be best to arrange a ceasefire with the Sepoys. Despite the fervour opposition from the supporters of Palmerston, the public support towards the war has declined from continued humiliating defeats. It is time to make a cease of violence."
 ENG_treaty_mughals:0 "Treaty with the Mughals"
 ENG_treaty_mughals_desc:0 "Our ceasefire has come to an agreement, and we have succeeded in coming to peace. However, the Rebellion still has the upper hand, and we have made our ceasefire with the attitude of surrender. It has been a humiliating war, but to secure as much as we can, we retract our claims on the entire subcontinent."
 ENG_south_india_colony:0 "The South India Colony"
 ENG_south_india_colony_desc:0 "Our failure against the Mughals has pushed us out from Delhi, and our colony has been restricted to the Southern part. We must adapt; reorganising what remains of the East Indian Company into the South Indian Colony will solidify our struggle against the  rebellious state in the north."

vbritain.1.t:0 "Opening of the British Museum Reading Room"
vbritain.1.d:0 "Since the early 1850s, the British Museum needed a bigger reading room. The idea of a huge circular room quickly came up, and the works started in 1854, overseen by the architect Sydney Smirke, and finished this week. The building itself is made of cast iron, concrete and glass, and was inspired by the Pantheon of Rome in its design and colors."
vbritain.1.a:0 "A wonderful building"

vbritain.2.t:0 "Victoria Cross awards in Hyde Park"
vbritain.2.d:0 "Following the Crimean War, some British Troops had distinguished themselves from their fellow men by acts of bravery or ingenuity, and today is the day our country will reward them for it. Queen Victoria has awarded 66 Victorian Crosses today at a ceremony in London to our best men. Royal Troops have proven their worth once more!"
vbritain.2.a:0 "For the valient soldiers of Britannia"

vbritain.3.t:0 "The Orsini Affair"
vbritain.3.d:0 "A attack as hit the french emperor Napoleon III today in Paris. While the perpetrator was the italian revolutionary Felice Orsini, a french investigation has shown that the bomb used for the attack was made in the United Kingdom. This has put us in a difficult position with the french government, and they are waiting for a response from us."
vbritain.3.a:0 "We need to investigate this"

vbritain.4.t:0 "Religious Revolts in Belfast"
vbritain.4.d:0 "In Belfast today, a crowd of Catholics is fighting another Protestants crowd, led by the evengelical presbytarian Hugh Hanna, in the streets. The riot seems to have propagated to other neighboring cities, like Derry, Portadown or even Lurgan. The police has been sent on the scene, but they seem to mostly join the Protestant side of the fight."
vbritain.4.a:0 "Support the police's choice"
vbritain.4.b:0 "We need to protect both crowds equally"

vbritain.5.t:0 "The Matrimonial Clauses Act"
vbritain.5.d:0 "Talks started today on an act that would let married couple to divorce without the formal approval of a parliamentary body, and moving the matter from an ecclesiastical court to a civil court. This would, in practice, make marriage less of a sacrament, and more of a contract between the husband and wife. While the proposal has gathered support in the parliament, there are still some oppposition."
vbritain.5.a:0 "Push for the Act"
vbritain.5.b:0 "Let the Parliament decide"

vbritain.6.t:0 "Results of the vote for the Matrimonial Clauses Act"
vbritain.6.d:0 "Lord Parmerston announced today the succesful vote of the Matrimonial Clauses Act. Despite the disapproval of some proheminent figures like the bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce and the attempted fillibuster of the liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, a push from Lord Palmerston gave the bill enough momentum to pass. It is expected to be enacted on Jaunuary 1st of the next year."

vbritain.7.a:0 "Wonderful !"

vbritain.8.t:0 "Results of the vote for the Matrimonial Clauses Act"
vbritain.8.d:0 "Lord Parmerston announced today the failed vote of the Matrimonial Clauses Act. Political pressure on both the conservative and the Church-supporting liberal side of the Parliament was too much for the act to gain popularity. It is seen as a failure of the Palmerston government, and will surely weaken his grip, both on the House of Lord and the House of Commons."

The popular sport has gripped the young men of our nation in a way no other activity has yet before, and it was only a matter of time before the first organizations on this subject were founded. Today, the first Football Club in Britain is founded in Sheffield, called the Sheffield FC. We predict that this sport will continue to see an increase in popularity in the future."

vbritain.11.t:0 "Piedmontese revolutionary leave his exile"
vbritain.11.d:0 "Felice Orsini has left his exile in London. He and his father was arrested during the 1848 Italian war of Independance, and was imprisonned for life before his pardon by pope Pius IX. After going around Europe, trying to find a good place to stay while he can't go back to his home land, he ended up in the United Kingdom were he was well received. While in his London exile though, he is suspected to still be in contact with revolutionaries, and he might plot something against a great figure. He seemed to leave the UK to reach France, who knows what he might do there."

Republicanism is now a new idea in british politics, started with the Cromwellian Commonwealth, the United Kingdom has always seen the republic as a possibility, but it has fainted during the golden days of the british empire. However, with the rise of socialism, with the Chartists, and with the new wave of free-thought and strive for liberty, the republic is put once again on the table. Now that the monarchy is weak, a simple blow by a republican prime minister would be enough to make the dream of a British Republic, a reality."

Projected, the image of the Sun produced by an optical telescope through a broad-band filter makes a solar flare obvious to the eye, as it produce a good amound of H-alpha radiation, adding a narrow, around 1 Å, passband filter centered at this wavelength. While it might not be clear what causes such events on the surface of our Sun, it has excited the astronomical world greatly. More observations will be needed though, and with more precise instrumentation."
